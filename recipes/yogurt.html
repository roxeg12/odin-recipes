    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A super simple 5 minute breakfast or snack, this extra thick greek yogurt bowl is super convenient, healthy, and satisfying, 
        yet also super customizable. Take the best greek yogurt you know, your favorite flavor of pudding mix, frozen fruit of your choice,
        and cereal, granola, or any other kind of crunch! Make this bowl taste how you want, and fit your macros.
    </p>
    <p>This is my favorite late night snack and is something I have every single day without fail. My go-to version: nonfat chobani
        mixed with sugar free vanilla pudding mix, topped with frozen blueberries and a random cinnamon cereal.
    </p>
