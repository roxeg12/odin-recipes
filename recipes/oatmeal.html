    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A breakfast classic, this is just another copy of the wheel - no reinventing here.</p>
    <p>The same warm, spiced, sweet oatmeal that tastes just like apple pie, but made more satiating and muscle building for 
        those of us looking to stay full until lunch or hit the day's protein goal.
    </p>
    <p>Super easy to throw together after a morning gym session, and even easier to throw together the night before to take on the go, this is 
        the perfect and macro friendly breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>From my table to yours,</p>
    <p>Roxana</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup old fashioned rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 cup liquid of your choice: water for lower cals, filtered milk for higher protein </li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon chia seeds</li>
        <li>1 scoop protein powder of your choice - cinnamon adjacent flavor would work best,
            but vanilla or even unflavored work too!
        </li>
        <li>1 apple</li>
        <li>ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>ground cloves</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li class="optional">Optional: maple syrup or honey</li>
        <li class="Optional">Optional: peanut butter</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the full cup of liquid to a boil in a saucepan or small pot. Add in the oatmeal and chia seeds
            and let cook for at least 5 minutes or until desired thickness.
        </li>
        <li>While waiting for the water to boil and oatmeal to cook, begin preparing the powdered mixture. Add the protein powder and spices into a bowl.
            Measure with your heart, remembering that while you can never have too much cinnamon, a dash of each of the others should be enough. 
        </li>
        <li>Fully mix the hot cooked oatmeal with the powder mixture and a splash of vanilla extract. If too thick or dry, add a splash of milk or water as well.
            If using unflavored protein powder, you can optionally mix in sweetener like honey or maple syrup.
        </li>
        <li>Roughly dice the apple and top the oatmeal with it. Sprinkle more cinnamon on top, and optionally, drizzle honey, syrup, and/or peanut buuter on top.</li>
    </ol>
