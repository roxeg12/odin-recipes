    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Entomatadas are a traditional Mexican dish similar to enchiladas. Both are fried stuffed tortillas covered in sauce and cheese,
        but while enchilada sauce is chile based, entomatadas are covered in a light, yet flavorful tomato sauce.

    <p>This recipe is my mother's, written with the memories of evenings filled with anticipation, the smell of garlic, onion, and tomato spilling
        out of the kitchen, as I waited to devour my favorite meal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/4 of an onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 cube of chicken boullion</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno pepper</li>
        <li>1 chicken breast</li>
        <li>queso fresco</li>
        <li>4 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>canola or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>mexican crema</li>
        <li>avocado</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the chicken breast in salted water, along with the onion, garlic, and bay leaves. The tomatoes can also be 
            boiled until just before soft, or optionally roasted. When the chicken is fully cooked through, remove everything from the water and set aside. 
            Shred the chicken to desired texture.
        </li>
        <li>Blend the cooked tomatoes, onion, and garlic along with the jalapeno and chicken stock cube in a splash of the freshly boiled chicken broth. 
            Add enough liquid for the sauce to flow and coat the tortillas, yet stay thick enough to sit on top of them. Pour this sauce in a pan and heat to just below a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shallow fry each corn tortilla in oil and immediately dip into the heated tomato sauce. Place the coated 
        </li>
